### Ever wondered what it would be like if you traded stocks simply based on Donald Trump's tweets?

StockingTrump is a project that:
1) Scraped tweets off Donald's Trump's Twitter
2) Used a sentiment analysis API to determine whether the tweets were positive, negative or neutral
3) Parsed a CSV containing stock data based on the companies most frequently mentioned in Trump's tweets
4) Depending on the sentiment, sold or bought a certain company's stocks

### Result:
By using $1000 as the price of each purchase/sale, net profit was:
$9990.02
